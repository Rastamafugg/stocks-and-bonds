Edition 0.5, December 2022 Not finished yet, input welcome!

This bookwouldn’t be possible without the amazingwork of DennisM. Ritchie, KenThompson, Brian W. Kernighan, Alfred Aho, Rob Pike, Stephen Bourne, and a host of others. The co-creations of Unix and C have had impossible-to-overstate impacts on the development of the modern world. It is upon their shoulders we all stand. The DCC standard libraries (clib.l and clibt.l) are based on earlier libraries written and/or compiled by Carl Kreider, possibly with additional code by Simmule Turner (getopt); with additional code and bug fixes by Jeff Teunissen. The information in this book is compiled from the source code to, and original documentation for, the DCC standard library and the OS-9 Level II C graphics library; with additional reference to the OS-9 Level II Technical Manual, the UNIX Programmer’s Manual (7th ed., vol. 1), The Linux Documentation Project, and the Linuxman-pages project. The information contained in this book is believed to be accurate as of the date of publication; however, the CoCoC project disclaims any responsibility for any damages, including indirect or consequential, from the use of the DCC compiler system or from reliance on the accuracy of this documentation. The information contained herein is subject to change without notice.

## Chapter 1. The C Standard Library

Thestandard library contains functionswhich fall into two classes: the standard I/O package (often abbreviated as “stdio”, after its header file <stdio.h>) and convenience functions. The standard I/O functions provide facilities that are normally considered part of the definitions of other languages; for example, the FORMAT statement in FORTRAN. In addition, automatic buffering of I/O channels improves file throughput because fewer system calls are necessary. The convenience functions include facilities for copying, comparing, and concatenating strings, converting numbers to strings, and doing the extra work in accessing system information such as the time. In the following pages, the functions available are described in terms of what they do and the parameters they expect. The Synopsis section shows the name of each function and the type (if any) it returns. The declaration of arguments is shown as it would be written in the function definition, to indicate the types expected by the function. The header file in which a function is declared is shown in the Synopsis section by preceding the example function call with #include <filename>.

### Header files

Each function in the standard library is declared in at least one header file, which are files containing declarations and definitions meant to be pulled in by the C preprocessor using the #include directive. Most header files reside in the DEFS directory on the default system drive: if the file name is enclosed in angle bracket delimiters (<>), the preprocessor searches for it relative to this directory. For example, if /DD is the path name of the default system drive, then #include <stdio.h> is equivalent to #include "/DD/DEFS /stdio.h". Please note that because the C compiler assumes any undeclared function returns int, if you don’t include the header file that declares a function and that function returns another type, you may have unexpected results. It’s almost always better to include the header file, but you may choose to declare used functions in your program yourself before calling them. For example, if youwish to use atof() but don’t want to #include <stdlib.h>, you should at least declare it by writing double atof();. Failure to do so may result in unexpected behavior at runtime.

### Standard I/O

The standard I/O functions implement an efficient user-level buffering scheme. The functions fgetc() and fputc() are the basic input and output functions. The

higher level routines that read or write data essentially call one of them in a loop. Actual file input/output for these buffered files is performed in batches, when the buffer is detected to be empty (for read mode) or full (for write mode). A file with its associated buffer is called a stream, and is declared to be a pointer to a defined type FILE. The function fopen() opens a file using an OS-9 system call, and associates that file with a stream. The standard I/O functions should not be confused with the low-level system call functions, many of which have similar names. Nor should file streams be confused with path numbers, also called file descriptors or just fds. Passing a stream to a system call, or a file descriptor to a standard I/O function, is a common mistake made by new or unwary users of the C standard library. When it occurs, the usual result is a program crash or hang. Be careful!

### abort

**Cause abnormal program termination**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

abort()
```

#### Description

The abort function writes the program’s memory to the file core in the current working directory. After this “core dump” is written, the program exits with a status of 1.

#### Return Value

This function never returns.

#### See Also
[exit](#exit-exit), _exit — Task termination

### abs

**Get the absolute value of an integer**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int abs(i)
int i;
```

#### Description

The abs function returns the absolute value (distance from zero on the number line) of its integer argument.

#### Caveats

Attempting to get the absolute value of the most negative integer returns the most negative integer. That is, abs(-32768) gives -32768.

#### See Also
[fabs()](#fabs)

### asctime, ctime

**Format date and time into a string**

### assert

**Program verification**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <assert.h>

assert(expression);
```

#### Description

assert is a macro that indicates that expression is expected to be true at this point in the program. If the expression is false (zero), it causes an abort() after emitting a diagnostic comment on the standard error output. If the macro NDEBUG is defined when <assert.h> was most recently included, assert does nothing and produces no code. It is recommended to define NDEBUG only when not looking for error conditions.

#### Diagnostics

F:N: Assertion 'expression' failed

In this example, F is the source file, and N the source line number of the call to assert.

### atof, atoi, atol

**Convert ASCII string to a number**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

double atof (str)
char *str;

int atoi (str)
char *str;

long atol (str)
char *str;
```

#### Description

The initial part of the string str is converted to floating point, integer, or long integer. Conversion stops when an unrecognized character is encountered. atof recognizes optional leading whitespace, then an optional sign, then a string of digits optionally containing a decimal point, then an optional E or e, then an optional sign, then a non-empty sequence of decimal digits indicating multiplication by a power of 10. atoi and atol recognize optional leading whitespace, then an optional sign, then a string of digits.

#### Notes

Whitespace is as recognized by isspace(). A sign is one of the characters + or -.

#### Bugs

Overflow may cause unpredictable results. There is no error reporting.

#### See Also
[scanf()](#scanf-fscanf-sscanf)

### bsearch

**Binary search of a sorted array**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

char *bsearch (key, base, count, size, compar)
char *key, *base;
size_t count, size;
int (*compar) ();
```

#### Description

bsearch searches an array of count objects, the first member of which is pointed to by base, for amember thatmatches the object pointed to by key. The size of eachmember of the array is specified by size. The contents of the array should already be in ascending order according to the comparison function compar. The compar routine is expected to take two pointer arguments, which point to key and to an array member, in that order; and should return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if key is found to be less than, to match, or to be greater than the array member.

#### Return Value

On success, bsearch returns a pointer to a matching member of the array, or NULL if no match is found. If multiple elements match, it is unspecified which of them is returned.

#### Notes

For string variables, strcmp()may be a good choice for compar.

#### See Also
[strcmp()](#strcmp-strncmp), [qsort()](#qsort)

### exp[10], log[10], pow

**Exponential and logarithmic functions**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <math.h>

double exp (x)
double x;

double exp10 (x)
double x;

double log (x)
double x;

double log10 (x)
double x;

double pow (x, y)
double x, y;
```

Link with -t.

#### Description

The exp function returns Euler’s number e (the base of the natural logarithm, e ≈ 2.71828…) raised to the power x.

exp10 returns the value 10 raised to the power x. For backward compatibility with earlier versions of the library, exp10 is also available under the name antilg.

pow returns the value x raised to the power y.

log returns the natural logarithm of x.

log10 returns the common (base 10) logarithm of x.

#### Notes

```text
While (for example) exp(x) and pow(M_E, x) are equivalent and should result in the same
value, the former is generally preferred as it is likely to execute more quickly.
```

### fabs

**Get absolute value of floating-point number**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <math.h>

double fabs(x)
double x;
```

#### Description

The fabs function returns the absolute value of the floating-point number x. If the number is negative, the value returned is the same, except positive. For backward compatibility, this function also has the name dabs.

#### See Also
[abs()](#abs)

### fclose

**Close a stream**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int fclose (stream)
FILE *stream;
```

#### Description

The fclose function flushes the stream pointed to by stream (writing any buffered output it contains using fflush()), and closes the underlying path number. The behavior of fclose is undefined if stream is not a valid pointer to an open stream. fclose is automatically performed for each open file by exit() and normal program termination.

#### Return Value

On success, 0 is returned; otherwise, EOF is returned and errno is set. Regardless of error status, any further access to the stream (including another call to fclose) results in undefined behavior.

#### See Also
[fflush()](#fflush), system call close — close a file

### feof, ferror, clearerr

**Check and reset stream status**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

clearerr (stream)
FILE *stream;

int feof (stream)
FILE *stream;

int ferror (stream)
FILE *stream;
```

#### Description

feof returns a nonzero value if the file associated with stream has reached its end. zero is returned on error.

ferror returns a nonzero value if an error condition has occurred during any call using stream; zero is returned if no error has occurred. Stream error conditions persist, preventing further access by other standard library functions until the stream is closed or the error is cleared by clearerr.

clearerr resets the error condition on stream. This does not fix the error condition itself or prevent the error from occurring again – it merely allows standard library functions to attempt to use the stream again.

#### Caveats

These functions are implemented as macros defined in <stdio.h>, so their names may not be re-declared.

#### See Also
[fopen()](#fopen-freopen), [fseek()](#fseek-ftell-rewind), system call open()

### fflush

**Flush a stream buffer**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int fflush (stream)
FILE *stream;
```

#### Description

fflush causes any buffered data associated with stream to be written out to the associated file or device; because input and output are not buffered simultaneously in this implementation, this has an effect only on streams that have been opened for write or update. The open status of the stream is unaffected.

#### Diagnostics

EOF is returned if stream is a not an output stream, or if there is an error writing to the file.

#### Notes

It is not normally necessary to call fflush, but it can be useful whenmixing output between stdout (which is normally buffered) and stderr (which is not). If fflush is not used and stdout and stderr are both connected to a terminal, it is possible for stderrmessages to appear before messages written to stdout, even when the write to stdout was performed first. Calling fflush(stdout) before a write to stderrmay help in this case. Normal program termination indirectly causes all open streams to be flushed.

#### See Also
[fopen()](#fopen-freopen), [setbuf()](#setbuf)

### fgetc, getc, getchar, ungetc

**Character input from streams**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int fgetc (stream)
FILE *stream;

int getc (stream)
FILE *stream;
```

int getchar()

```text
int ungetc (c, stream)
int c;
FILE *stream;
```

#### Description

fgetc reads the next character from stream and returns its integer value, or EOF if end of file or an error is encountered.

getc is equivalent to fgetc, except that it may be implemented as amacrowhich evaluates streammore than once. At this time, this is not true of this implementation.

getchar is a macro, equivalent to fgetc (stdin).

ungetc pushes c back to stream. The input file buffer is altered such that the next call to fgetc returns c. Up to one character may be pushed back, and at least one character must have been read from stream before a call to ungetcmay be made. Any subsequent call to fseek() will erase any push-back done with ungetc.

#### Notes

UnderOS-9 there are two differentways to get input from afile or device. The read() system call will read characters up to a specified number in “raw” mode; that is, no editing takes place on the input stream, and characters appear to the program exactly as present in the file. On the other hand, the readln() system call honors the variousmappings of characters associated with a character device (such as a terminal), allows a user to edit text to be input, and returns a final string to the caller once a carriage return is seen on the input. In the vast majority of cases, it is preferable to use readln() for accessing character devices, and read() for any other file input; so on OS-9, fgetc uses this strategy and, since most stream input using the standard library functions is routed through fgetc, so do most other

input functions. The choice is made when the first call to fgetc is made after the file has been opened. The system is consulted for the status of the file, and a flag is set in the file structure accordingly. The choice may be forced by the programmer by setting the relevant bit before any calls to fgetc are made. The flags for doing this are defined in <stdio.h> as _SCF and _RBF, and the method is as follows: Given a stream f, f->_flag |= _SCF; will force the use of readln() for text input on f; and f->_flag |= _RBF; will force the use of read(). This trick may also be played on the standard input stream stdin without the need to call fopen(), provided this is done before any input has been requested.

#### Diagnostics

EOF is returned in case of end-of-file or error, and errno is set accordingly.

### fgets

**Read a string from a stream**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

char *fgets(s, size, stream)
char *s;
int size;
FILE *stream;
```

#### Description

fgets reads up to (size−1) characters from stream and stores them into the buffer pointed to by s. Reading stops after encountering end of file or a newline. If a newline is read, it is stored in the buffer. A terminating null character is stored after the last character read. A line of arbitrary length may be read using a limited-size buffer by checking the last character of the returned string for newline; if the last character read is a newline, or a subsequent call to fgets returns NULL (as occurs when end of file is encountered before successfully reading any characters), then the read is complete.

#### Return Value

fgets returns s on success, and NULL on error or when end of file occurred after having read no characters.

[fread()](#fread-fwrite), [fgetc()](#fgetc-getc-getchar-ungetc), [puts()](#fputc-fputs-putc-putchar-puts), [scanf()](#scanf-fscanf-sscanf)

### fopen, freopen

**Open a stream**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

FILE *fopen (pathname, mode)
char *pathname, *mode;

FILE *freopen (pathname, mode, stream)
char *pathname, *mode;
FILE *stream;
```

#### Description

fopen opens the file whose name is the string pointed to by pathname, and associates it with a stream. The argument mode points to a string beginning with one of the following sequences:

r Open for reading. The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.

r+ Open for reading and writing. The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.

w Truncate file to zero length or create file for writing. The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.

w+ Truncate file to zero length or create file for reading and writing. The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.

a Open for appending (writing at end of file). The file is created if it doesn’t exist. The stream is positioned at the end of the file.

a+ Open for reading and appending. The file is created if it doesn’t exist. Output is always written to the end of the file.

d Open a directory for reading. The stream is positioned at the beginning of the directory. This is an extension, not necessarily portable to other systems.

As an extension, any mode may have an x immediately after the initial letter, indicating that relative paths are relative to the current execution directory, and that the file should have execute permission. For example, f = fopen ("fred", "wx+");

Three streams are pre-opened at program start:

All streams are automatically buffered except stderr, unless explicitly made unbuffered by calling setbuf().

freopen opens the file whose name is pointed to by pathname, and associates it with stream. The original stream, if it exists, is closed. The mode argument is used just as in the fopen function. The primary use of freopen is to change the file associated with a standard text stream (stdin, stdout, stderr).

#### Caveats

The mode passed as an argument must be a string, not a character constant. It is a common error to pass a character literal (which is of type int) rather than a string containing one character.

#### Diagnostics

These functions return NULL if the open was unsuccessful, and set errno accordingly.

#### Bugs

This implementation does not currently support the bmodifier from the ANSI standard for mode. If used, these functions will fail.

[fclose()](#fclose), fdopen(), system call open()

### fputc, fputs, putc, putchar, puts

**Character output to streams**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int fputc (c, stream)
int c;
FILE *stream;

int fputs (s, stream)
char *s;
FILE *stream;

int putc (c, stream)
int c;
FILE *stream;

int putchar (c)
int c;

int puts (s)
char *s;
```

#### Description

fputc writes the character c to stream at the current writing position.

fputs writes the string s to stream, without its terminating null character.

putc is equivalent to fputc, except it may be implemented as a macro which evaluates its argument multiple times. At this time, this is not true of this implementation.

putchar is a macro, equivalent to fputc(c, stdout). Output via fputc is normally buffered except when the buffering is disabled by a call to setbuf(), or the stream being written to is stderr.

puts writes the string s, and a trailing newline, to stdout.

#### Diagnostics

fputc, putc, and putchar return c from a successful call, and EOF on end of file or error. fputs and puts return a non-negative number on success, and EOF on end of file or error.

#### Caveats

The puts function appends a newline, while fputs does not. This inconsistency is dictated by history and backwards compatibility.

#### See Also
[fgetc()](#fgetc-getc-getchar-ungetc), [fwrite()](#fread-fwrite), [printf()](#printf-fprintf-sprintf)

### fread, fwrite

**Binary stream input/output**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

size_t fread (ptr, size, count, stream)
char *buf;
size_t size, count;
FILE *stream;

size_t fwrite (ptr, size, count, stream)
char *buf;
size_t size, count;
FILE *stream;
```

#### Description

fread reads count items of data, each size bytes in length, from the stream pointed to by stream, and stores them in the buffer pointed at by ptr.

fwrite writes count items of data, each size bytes in length, to stream; reading from the memory area pointed at by ptr.

#### Return Value

On success, these functions return the number of items actually read or written. The only time that number is equal to the number of bytes transferred is when size is 1. If end of file is reached, or if an error occurs, the number of items read/written will be less than requested (or zero). When reading or writing multiple objects, it may be useful to use a construction such as: if (count != fread (ptr, sizeof (int), count, stream)) {

```text
/* executed on short read */
}
```

#### Notes

The best way to find the appropriate size is usually by use of the sizeof operator. fread does not distinguish between the end of file and error conditions; use feof() or ferror() to find out which occurred.

#### See Also
[feof()](#feof-ferror-clearerr), [ferror()](#feof-ferror-clearerr), system calls read(), [Write](#write-writeln), Writeln — write to a file or device

### frexp

**Split a floating-point number into its components**

#### Synopsis

#### Description

#### See Also
### fseek, ftell, rewind

**Reposition a stream**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int fseek (stream, offset, whence)
FILE *stream;
long offset;
int whence;

long ftell (stream)
FILE *stream;

rewind (stream)
FILE *stream;
```

#### Description

fseek repositions the next character position for the stream pointed to by stream. The new position is obtained by adding offset bytes to the position specified by whence. If whence is set to SEEK_SET(0), SEEK_CUR(1), or SEEK_END(2), the offset is relative to the start of the file, the current position, or the file’s end, respectively. A successful call to fseek clears the end-of-file indicator, and undoes any effects of ungetc() on the same stream.

ftell retrieves the current file position (measured in bytes from the beginning) for the stream pointed to by stream.

rewind performs the equivalent of fseek (stream, 0L, SEEK_SET); to return the file position to the beginning of the file. In addition, the error indicator for stream is also cleared (see clearerr()).

#### Return Value

On success, fseek returns 0, and ftell returns the current offset; otherwise EOF is returned and errno is set to indicate the error. The rewind function returns no value.

#### See Also
System call lseek — position in file

### gets

**Read a string from stdin (deprecated)**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

char *gets(s)
char *s;
```

#### Description

gets reads a line from stdin into the buffer pointed to by s, reading until either a terminating newline or EOF is encountered. Once reading is complete, a terminating null byte is stored in the buffer.

#### Return Value

gets returns s on success, and NULL on error or when end of file is encountered before any characters are read.

#### Bugs

gets is broken by design. It is impossible to tell, without knowing the data in advance, how many characters gets will read. Because the function has no built-in limiting functionality, it is able to overwrite any possible buffer you can allocate and is perfectly capable of destroying the program. Never use this function.

#### See Also
[fgets()](#fgets), [fputc()](#fputc-fputs-putc-putchar-puts), [fgetc()](#fgetc-getc-getchar-ungetc), [fread()](#fread-fwrite), [puts()](#fputc-fputs-putc-putchar-puts), [scanf()](#scanf-fscanf-sscanf)

### is*

**Character classification functions**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <ctype.h>
isclass(c);
```

#### Description

These functions use a look-up table to classify characters according to their character value. The header file defines them as macros, which means that they are implemented as inline code rather than a function call. Each results in non-zero for true, or zero for false. The value is guaranteed to be correct for any integer values in ASCII, but the result is unpredictable outside the range J−1..127K. The truth tested by each function is as follows:

isalpha c is a letter

isdigit c is a digit

### 

****

islower c is a lower case letter a-z

isalnum c is a letter or a digit

isspace c is a white space character (horizontal or vertical tab, newline, carriage return, line-feed, form-feed)

iscntrl c is a control character (J0..32, 127K) ispunct c is neither a control character, nor alphanumeric

isprint c is printable J32..126K isascii c is in the range J−1..127K (-1 is a special case)

### localtime

### malloc, calloc, realloc, free

**Allocate and freememory**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

char *malloc (size)
size_t size;

free (ptr)
char *ptr;

char *calloc (nmemb, size)
size_t nmemb, size;

char *realloc (ptr, size)
char *ptr;
size_t size;
```

#### Description

The malloc family of functions dynamically allocate memory for the program’s use, by requesting new blocks of memory no smaller than 1 page (256 bytes) from OS-9 and subdividing those blocks into memory regions returned. There is a small amount of overhead involved in that the allocator must maintain some accounting information used to mark “allocated” vs. “free” sections.

The malloc function allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocatedmemory. No attempt is made to initialize the memory allocated to any value or pattern.

calloc allocates space for an array of nmembmembers, each of which is size bytes wide, and returns a pointer to thememory allocated. calloc initializes the allocated space to zero.

realloc changes the size of the memory block pointed to by ptr, to size bytes. The contents will be unchanged in the range from the start of the region, up to the minimum of the old and new sizes. If the new size is larger than the old size, the added memory will not be initialized. If ptr is NULL, the call is equivalent to malloc(size). If size is zero, the call is equivalent to free(ptr).

free releases memory pointed to by ptr, which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc, calloc, or realloc. Otherwise, or if free(ptr) has already been called before, the result is not defined. If ptr is NULL, nothing is done.

#### Return Value

malloc and calloc return NULL if no free memory can be added, or if there was an error. NULLmay also be returned by malloc with a size of zero, or by calloc with nmemb or size equal to zero. free returns no value. The pointer returned by realloc may be the same as ptr if the allocation was able to add bytes to the previously allocated memory block, or it may be different if it was necessary to move the allocation to a new address. If realloc fails the original block is left unmodified, neither freed nor moved.

#### Notes

calloc does not check that the multiplication nmemb * size will not result in integer overflow, but due to address space limitations of the 6x09 attempting to allocatemore than 65535 bytes will not succeed.

System calls ibrk, [brk()](#brk-sbrk), unbrk

### memchr

**Scanmemory for a character**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <string.h>

char *memchr (s, c, n)
char *s;
int c;
size_t n;
```

#### Description

The memchr function scans the initial n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s for the first instance of c. Both c and the bytes of the memory area are interpreted as unsigned char.

#### Return Value

The memchr function returns a pointer to the matching byte, or NULL if the character is not found in the given memory area.

#### See Also
[strchr()](#strchr-strrchr)

### memcpy, memccpy

**Copy amemory area**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <string.h>

char *memcpy (dest, src, n)
char *dest, *src;
size_t n;

char *memccpy (dest, src, c, n)
char *dest, *src;
int c;
size_t n;
```

#### Description

The memcpy function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest.

memccpy copies up to n bytes frommemory area src tomemory area dest, stopping when the character c is encountered. For both functions, the two memory areas must not overlap.

#### Return Value

memcpy returns a pointer to dest. memccpy returns a pointer to the next byte in dest after c, or NULL if c was not found in the first n bytes of src.

#### See Also
[strcpy()](#strcpy-strncpy)

### memset

**Fill memory area with a constant byte**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <string.h>

char *memset (s, c, n)
char *s;
int c;
size_t n;
```

#### Description

The memset functionwrites the byte value of c to the first n bytes of thememory area pointed to by s.

#### Return Value

The memset function returns a pointer to the memory area s.

#### See Also
calloc()

### printf, fprintf, sprintf

**Formatted output conversion**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int printf (format, ...)
char *format;

int fprintf (stream, format, ...)
FILE *stream;
char *format;

int sprintf (str, format, ...)
char *str, *format;
```

#### Description

The functions in the printf family produce output described by a format string as described below. printf sends its output to stdout, fprintf outputs to stream, and sprintf formats into a buffer pointed at by str. The format string determines the form, type, and number of the arguments expected by the function. If the format does not match the arguments correctly, the results are unpredictable. The formatmay contain characters to be copied directly to the output and/or format specifications. Each format specification causes the function to take the next successive argument for the next output conversion. Each conversion specification begins with a % character. Following the %, there may be

• An optional minus sign (-), denoting the use of left justification in the field.

• Anoptional sequence of decimal digits indicating afieldwidth. Thefieldwill be at least this wide, and may be wider if the conversion requires it. The field will be padded on the left unless the above minus sign is present, in which case it will be padded on the right. The padding character is by default a space, but if the field width starts with a zero (0), it will be zero-padded instead.

• An optional period (.) and a sequence of decimal digits, the precision, which for floating point arguments indicates the number of digits to follow the decimal point on conversion, and for strings, the maximum number of characters from the string argument that are to be accepted from the input.

• An optional character l indicates that the following d, o, x, or X specifies a long int argument instead of int.

• A conversion character which shows the type of the argument and the desired conversion. The recognized conversion characters are:

% Does not consume an argument; inserts a literal % character. c The int argument is interpreted as an ASCII character. s Characters from the char * argument are copied up to the next null char-

acter, or until the number of characters indicated by the field precision have been copied. If the precision is zero or missing, characters are not counted.

d, o, x, X The int argument is formatted as a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal string. X prints in upper case.

u The int argument is formatted as a decimal number in the range 0..65535. f The double argument is formatted as [-]nnn.nnn, where the digits after

the decimal point are specified as above. If not specified, the precision defaults to six digits. If the precision is 0, no decimal point or following digits are printed.

e, E The double argument is formatted using scientific E notation as [-]n.nnne±nn; with one digit before the decimal point, and the precision controlling the number of following digits. Using E as a format specifier results in upper case.

g, G The double argument is formatted in either f format or e format, whichever produces the shortest string.

#### Notes

In order to save program space, by default printf does not contain code to format long integers or floating point numbers. If you need to format long integers, your program must contain a reference to the function pflinit() to force the inclusion of the necessary code. Likewise, if you need to format floating point numbers, your program must reference the function pffinit() somewhere. Even if these functions are never called, the reference is sufficient to cause the code to be included. In double conversions, the final digit is rounded. When using sprintf, it is the caller’s responsibility to ensure that the buffer str is large enough to hold all output.

### qsort

**Sort an array**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

qsort (base, nmemb, size, compar)
char *base;
size_t nmemb, size;
int (*compar) ();
```

#### Description

qsort implements the quick-sort algorithm for sorting an arbitrary array of items. base is the address of an array of nmemb elements, each of which is size bytes in width. A comparison routine, compar, is supplied by the caller. The compar routine is called with two arguments, which are pointers to the elements being compared. The routine is expected to return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first argument is to be considered less than, equal to, or greater than, the second argument. In this manner, any arbitrary type of data may be sorted as long as the comparison function knows what it is.

### scanf, fscanf, sscanf

**Input string interpretation**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int scanf (format, ...)
char *format;

int fscanf (stream, format, ...)
FILE *stream;
char *format;

int sscanf (char *str, char *format, ...)
char *str, *format;
```

#### Description

The scanf family of functions performs the complement of the printf() family – interpreting formatted input and converting it into usable forms. The functions scan input according to format, as described below. The format may contain conversion specifications – the results from such conversions, if any, are stored in the locations pointed to by the pointer arguments following format. Each pointer argument must be typed appropriately by the corresponding conversion specifier. If the number of conversion specifications in format is greater than the number of pointer arguments following format, the results are undefined. If the number of pointer arguments is greater than the number of conversion specifications, any excess pointer arguments are ignored. The scanf function performs conversions from the standard input, fscanf converts from stream, and sscanf from the string pointed to by str. Each function expects a format string containing conversion specifications, and zero or more pointers to objects into which the converted values may be stored. The format string consists of a series of directives describing how the function is to process the input. If at any time a directive fails, no further input is interpreted and the function returns. A directive is one of the following:

• One or more whitespace characters (as recognized by isspace()), which matches zero or more whitespace characters in the input.

• An ordinary character (anything other thanwhitespace or %). Thismust exactlymatch the next input character.

• A conversion specification, beginning with % followed by:

– an optional * indicates suppression of assignment: the function reads input as directed, but discards the input, does not use a pointer argument, and does not count as a successful assignment.

– an optional decimal integer specifying themaximum field width. Reading stops when thismaximum is reached, or when any non-matching character is encountered. Most conversions discard initial whitespace characters, which don’t count toward the field width maximum. The terminating null byte used for string conversions also does not count towards the field width.

– A conversion specifier, one of the following: % Matches a literal %. The conversionmatches a single input % character.

No conversion is done, and no assignment takes place. [ Matches against a character set, defined between the initial [ and a ter-

minating ] character. Whitespace skipping is suppressed. The next pointer argument must be a pointer to the first character of an array long enough for the maximum field width plus a terminating null byte. Characters are copied from the input as long as they exist within the character set, unless the first character is a caret (^), in which case characters are copied until a character in the set is encountered.

c Matches a sequence of characters with a length specified by the maximum field width (default 1); the next pointer must be a pointer to char, and the pointed-to buffermust have space for all characters. No terminating null byte is written after the end. Whitespace skipping is suppressed— if you wish to skip spaces, insert a leading space before the conversion specification.

d Matches an optionally signed decimal integer string; the next pointer must be a pointer to int.

e, f Matches an optionally signedfloating-point number; the next pointer must be a pointer to float.

o Matches an unsigned octal integer string; the next pointer must be a pointer to unsigned int.

s Matches a sequence of non-whitespace characters; the next pointer must be a pointer to the first element of a character array long enough to hold the input sequence and the terminating null byte. The input string ends at the first whitespace character or the maximum field width, whichever comes first.

x Matches an unsigned hexadecimal integer string; the next pointer must be a pointer to unsigned int.

D Just like d, except the next pointer must be a pointer to long int. E, F Just like e and f, except the next pointer must be a pointer to double. O, X Just like o and x, except the next pointer must be a pointer to

unsigned long int.

Each of the functions returns a count of the number of fields successfully matched and assigned.

#### Caveats

The returned count of matches/assignments does not include character matches or assignments suppressed by *. The argumentsmust all be pointers. It is a common error to call scanf with the value of an item rather than a pointer to it.

#### Diagnostics

These functions return EOF on end of input or error and a count which is shorter than expected for unexpected or unmatched items.

### sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan

**Trigonometric functions**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <math.h>

double sin(x) double x;
double cos(x) double x;
double tan(x) double x;
double asin(x) double x;
double acos(x) double x;
double atan(x) double x;

deg();
rad();
```

Link with -t.

#### Description

The sin function computes the sine corresponding to an angle of x. In trigonometry, the sine function gives the ratio cos x between the opposite (vertical) side and the hypotenuse of a right triangle with the given angle.

x cos computes the cosine of the angle x. The cosine function gives the ratio between the adjacent (horizontal) side and the r =1

hypotenuse of a right triangle with the given angle.

tan computes the tangent of the angle x, where tangent is defined as tan x = sin x cos x = opposite

adjacent .

asin returns the inverse sine (sin−1 x, also known as the arcsine) of x , where x is a number representing the ratio between the opposite side of a right triangle and its hypotenuse (that is, the sine). Given the sine, the asin function is used to compute a matching angle.

acos returns the inverse cosine (cos−1 x, the arc cosine) of x. Given the cosine, the acos function is used to compute the original angle.

atan returns the inverse tangent (tan−1 x, the arc tangent) of x. Given the tangent, the atan function is used to compute the original angle.

sin x

tan x

#### Notes

To maximize speed, it is often better to save the results of a calculation for later reuse rather than to call the same function with the same argument a second time, or to pre-calculate a number of values that will be used at runtime. As an extension to the C standards, this implementation has the ability to perform trigonometric calculations using either radians or degrees. At program start, the trig functions are configured to use radians; calling the deg function causes subsequent calls to return and accept angles in degrees, and calling the rad function restores the default behavior. It is possible to detect which mode the functions are in, using the global _deg variable. When the value of _deg is nonzero, trigonometric functions operate using degrees as measurement; otherwise, they use radians. To avoid messing up user code, library functions that use trigonometry should always save and restore the mode of these functions before returning to the program.

#### Caveats

These functions generate an EILLARG (Illegal Argument) error when passed values outside the domain of the function. Because the tangent is defined as the slope of a line, the tan function is not defined for any oddmultiple of π

2 radians, or 90 degrees — that is, (±π 2 , 3π2 , 5π2 ⋯)

```text
or (±90°, 270°, 540°⋯).
The asin and acos functions are defined only over the interval [−1, 1].
```

### sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh

**Hyperbolic functions**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <math.h>

double sinh (x) double x;
double cosh (x) double x;
double tanh (x) double x;
double asinh (x) double x;
double acosh (x) double x;
double atanh (x) double x;
```

Link with -t.

#### Description

The sinh function implements the hyperbolic equivalent of the trigonometric sine function. Unlike the trigonometric functions, the hyperbolic functions are not periodic; the hyperbolic sine is defined as sinh x = e2x−1

2ex , where e is the base of the natural logarithm.

cosh implements the hyperbolic cosine function, defined as cosh x = e2x+1 2ex .

tanh returns the hyperbolic tangent, defined as tanh x = sinh x cosh x = e2x−1

e2x+1 .

asinh is the inverse of the sinh function, returning the original hyperbolic angle. It is defined as sinh−1 x = ln (x + √x2 + 1).

acosh is the inverse of the cosh function, returning the original hyperbolic angle. It is defined as cosh−1 x = ln (x + √x2 − 1).

atanh is the inverse of the tanh function, and is defined as tanh−1 x = 1 2 ln (

1+x 1−x)

#### Caveats

These functions generate an EILLARG (Illegal Argument) error when passed values outside the domain of the function. Because logarithms are not defined for real numbers less than or equal to zero, acosh is valid only over the interval [1, ∞); and atanh is valid only over the interval (−1, 1).

### setbuf

**Fix file buffer**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

setbuf (stream, buf)
FILE *stream;
char *buf;
```

#### Description

Immediately before the first character is read from or written to a newly opened stream, a buffer is obtained from the system and assigned to it. If you want to control or disable the buffering setbufmay be used to forestall this by assigning a user buffer to the file. setbufmust be used after the file has been opened and before any I/O has taken place. The buffer must be of sufficient size and a value for a manifest constant, BUFSIZ, is defined in the header file for use in declarations. If buf is NULL, the stream becomes unbuffered and characters are read or written singly.

#### Notes

The standard error output is unbuffered by default, and the standard output is buffered by default. This canmean that error outputmay actually be printed to the screen before normal output. For this reason, it is sometimes useful to call fflush() on stdout before writing to stderr.

### setjmp, longjmp

**Jump to another function**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <setjmp.h>

int setjmp (env)
jmp_buf env;

longjmp (env, val)
jmp_buf env;
int val;
```

#### Description

These functions allow the return of program control directly to a higher level function. They are most useful when dealing with errors and interrupts encountered in a low level routine. In C, the goto keyword has scope only in the function in which it is used; that is, a labelmust reside in the same function as any goto targeting it. Control may be transferred elsewhere only by means of a function call, which returns to the same location it was called from. In certain unusual situations, it is preferable to be able to start some section of code again, but this would mean returning up a ladder of function calls with error indications all the way. The functions described here are used for performing such “non-local gotos”: transferring execution from one function, to a predetermined location in another function. The setjmp function sets the target, and longjmp actually performs the jump. The setjmp function is used to save various information about the calling environment (the stack pointer, the program counter, and possibly other registers) in the buffer env for later use by a call to longjmp using that same buffer. When called, setjmp returns 0.

longjmp uses the information contained within the buffer env to transfer control back to the point where setjmp was called; and to restore, or “rewind”, the stack to its state when setjmp had been called, but before it had returned. Following a successful longjmp, execution continues as if setjmp had returned a second time. This “fake” return can be distinguished from the return value— setjmp always returns 0, while the return from a longjmp call is never zero (supplied in val, but if val is 0 it’s replaced by 1).

#### Notes

The function from which setjmp is called must not have returned when longjmp is called; if it has returned, the contents of the stack (including any auto variables declared within the function) will be unpredictable.

### sqrt

**Square root function**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <math.h>

double sqrt (x)
double x;
```

Link with -t.

#### Description

On success, the sqrt function returns the non-negative square root of x. If x is zero, zero is returned.

#### Caveats

Since this implementation does not support complex numbers, it is not possible to take the square root of a negative number.

### strcat, strncat

**Concatenate two strings**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <string.h>

char *strcat (dest, src)
char *dest, *src;

char *strncat (dest, src, n)
char *dest, *src;
size_t n;
```

#### Description

The strcat function appends the src string onto the end of the dest string, starting at the original terminating null byte, copying the bytes of src, and then appending a new terminating null byte. The strings may not overlap, and destmust be large enough to contain the new combined string.

strncat is similar, except that it uses at most n bytes from src; and if the length of src is at least n bytes, it does not need to be null-terminated. Just as with strcat, the resulting combined string is always null-terminated. As a consequence, the actual size of destmust be at least strlen(dest)+n+1 bytes to avoid a buffer overrun.

#### Return Value

The strcat and strncat functions return a pointer to the resulting string dest.

#### Caveats

These functions have no means of checking that the space provided is large enough to hold the combined string. If dest is not large enough, the program’s behavior becomes unpredictable — buffer overruns are an excellent way to attack programs that are meant to be secure.

#### See Also
[strchr()](#strchr-strrchr), [strcmp()](#strcmp-strncmp), [strcpy()](#strcpy-strncpy)

### strchr, strrchr

**Locate a character in string**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <string.h>

char *strchr(s, c)
char *s;
int c;

char *strrchr(s, c)
char *s;
int c;
```

#### Description

The strchr function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s.

strrchr returns a pointer to the last occurrence of the character c in the string s. index and rindex are alternate names for strchr and strrchr, respectively. In this implementation, they use the same code and may be used interchangeably without increasing program size.

#### Return Value

The strchr and strrchr functions return a pointer to the matched character, or NULL if the character was not found. The terminating null byte is considered part of the string, so if c is null ('\0'), these functions will return a pointer to the terminator.

#### Caveats

In these functions, “character”means “byte”; the argument c is cast to unsigned char before doing any comparisons.

#### See Also
[findstr()](#findstr-findnstr).

### strcmp, strncmp

**Compare two strings**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <string.h>

int strcmp (s1, s2)
char *s1, s2;

int strncmp (s1, s2, n)
char *s1, *s2;
size_t n;
```

#### Description

The strcmp function compares two strings, s1 and s2, for lexicographic order.

strncmp does the same, but instead of potentially continuing to check forever, compares at most n characters.

#### Return Value

These functions return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than 0 depending onwhether s1 is less than, equal to, or greater than s2.

#### See Also
[findstr()](#findstr-findnstr)

### strcpy, strncpy

**Copy string data**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <string.h>

char *strcpy (dest, src)
char *dest, *src;

char *strncpy (dest, src, n)
char *dest, *src;
size_t n;
```

#### Description

The strcpy function copies the string pointed to by src, including its terminating null byte, to the buffer pointed to by dest. The destination must be large enough to contain the copy, and the two memory areas may not overlap.

strncpy is similar, except at most n bytes are copied from src. If there is no null byte present in the first n bytes of src, the string placed in dest will not be null-terminated. If the length of src is fewer than n bytes, strncpy writes additional null bytes to ensure that exactly n bytes are written.

#### Return Value

Both functions return a pointer to the destination string.

#### Caveats

strcpy has no means of checking that the space provided is large enough. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure that string space does not overflow.

#### See Also
[findstr()](#findstr-findnstr), memcpy(), [strcat()](#strcat-strncat)

### strlen

**Get the length of a string**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <string.h>

size_t strlen (s)
char *s;
```

#### Description

The strlen function finds the length of the string pointed to by s, excluding its terminating null byte ('\0').

#### See Also
[findstr()](#findstr-findnstr), [strchr()](#strchr-strrchr), [strcmp()](#strcmp-strncmp), [strcpy()](#strcpy-strncpy)

### strpbrk

**Search a string for any of a set of bytes**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <string.h>

char *strpbrk (s, accept)
char *s, *accept;
```

#### Description

The strpbrk function locates the first occurrence within the string s, of any character found in the string accept.

#### Return Value

This function returns a pointer to a byte in s that is equal to one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no matching byte is present.

#### See Also
memchr(), [strchr()](#strchr-strrchr), [strspn()](#strspn-strcspn), [strtok()](#strtok)

### strspn, strcspn

**Get length of a prefix set**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <string.h>

size_t strspn (s, accept)
char *s, *accept;

size_t strcspn (s, reject)
char *s, *reject;
```

#### Description

The strspn function returns the length of the initial segment of s which consists only of characters present in the string accept.

strcspn is similar, except it returns the length of the initial segment of s which consists only of characters not present in the string reject. The second argument of these functions is treated as a set of characters, not as a substring. Each function

### strtok

**Extract tokens from a string**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <string.h>

char *strtok (str, delim)
char *str, *delim;
```

#### Description

### 

****

Each call to strtok returns a pointer to a null-terminated string containing the next token. This string does not include any delimiting bytes. If no more tokens are found, strtok returns NULL.

Intermediate state A sequence of calls to strtok operating on the same string maintains an internal pointer determining where to start searching for the next token. The first call to strtok initially sets this pointer to the first byte of str. The start of the next token is found by scanning forward for the next non-delimiter byte from the internal string pointer. If such a byte exists, it is recognized as the start of the next token. If no such byte exists, there are no more tokens and NULL is returned. In this way, a string that is empty or that contains only bytes found in delim, will return NULL the first time it is called.

The end of each token is found by scanning forward in the string until encountering either the next delimiter or a terminating null byte ('\0'). If a delimiter is found, it is overwritten with a null byte to end the current token, and strtok updates the internal pointer to the next byte for locating the next token. A pointer to the start of the token is then returned.

Under typical use, this means that a sequence of two or more adjacent delimiter bytes is considered to be a single delimiter, and delimiters at the start and end of a string are ignored (with the caveat that using different sets of delimiters can change this in various ways). That is, strtok does not return empty strings.

#### Return Value

The strtok function returns a pointer to the next token, or NULL if there are nomore tokens.

#### Caveats

This function modifies its first argument. For this reason, it should be noted that:

• You should not pass a pointer to a constant string as the first argument — that would cause strtok to modify the in-memory copy of the program, and on many systems it will actually succeed in corrupting it. This is bad.

• Since the delimiting byte ending a token is rewritten with a null byte on return, there is no way to tell the identity of the terminating delimiter.

### system

**Issue a shell command**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int system (command)
char *command;
```

#### Description

The system function uses os9fork() to create a child process that executes the OS-9 shell command command, and waits for it to exit. The exit status of the shell is returned.

#### Notes

The system function is simple and convenient, handling the details of creating a child process and waiting for it to exit; and by calling the OS-9 shell to run the program, it enables you to use I/O redirection for command. However, while convenience is gained, flexibility and efficiency are lost. If you don’t need to

#### Caveats

The maximum length of string for the command line is 80 characters. If a longer string is needed, call os9fork() directly.

#### See Also
System calls os9fork(), wait — wait for child process to end.

### time

**get the current clock time**

### tolower, toupper

**Convert uppercase or lowercase**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <ctype.h>

int tolower (c)
int c;

int toupper (c)
int c;
```

#### Description

These functions convert uppercase letters to lowercase, and vice versa. If the integer c has the value of an uppercase letter, tolower returns its lowercase equivalent; otherwise, it returns c.

toupper does the opposite: if c has the value of a lowercase letter, toupper returns its uppercase equivalent; otherwise, returning c. For both functions, cmust be within the range of the type unsigned char, or have the value EOF. For any other values, the result is undefined.

#### Notes

The header file <ctype.h> also defines the macros _tolower and _toupper as an extension to the C library. These macros are similar to the functions, except they don’t check their argument. _tolower always modifies its argument as if it were converting an uppercase letter to lowercase, and _toupper always modifies its argument as if converting from lowercase to uppercase. Use these macros only when you are certain of the input.

#### Bugs

The set of recognized letters is currently limited to the range of ASCII; extended characters are not considered.

## Chapter 2. Standard Library Extensions

TheDCC standard library contains a number of functions not present in C standards. Many of these extensions are from versions of the UNIX C libraries, and others are for compatibility with other versions of OS-9; but none of them are specified by C. This chapter introduces a new optional heading, Conforming To. In this and later chapters, Conforming To describes the origins of the function(s) being described—where they come from, and where else they may be used. A few names/acronyms that may not be familiar to everyone:

BSD The Berkeley Software Distribution, a version of Unix released by the University of California and forming the basis for many modern Unix-like systems. BSD was the start of one of the two major groups that took part in the “Unix wars” of the 1990s.

OSK An abbreviation of Microware’s version of OS-9 for Motorola 68000-derived processors, marketed variously as “Professional OS-9”, “OS-9 for 68000”, and “OS9/68K” at various times.

OS-9000 Microware’s flagship modern OS-9 product, a relatively portable reimplementation of the OS-9 operating system in the C language. Available for many different CPU types.

POSIX.1 The Portable Operating System Interface (formally, IEEE 1003) is a set of standard operating system interfaces based on the Unix operating system. POSIX is the entire set of standards, but “POSIX.1” defines the basic set of common C programming interfaces implemented bymostmodernUnix-like systems, whether it be Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS, etc. POSIX was, effectively, the peace treaty that mostly brought the competing Unix vendors back together.

SVID The SystemV Interface Definition, the specifications of which describe AT&TUNIX System V. System V is one of the attempts AT&T made to commercialize Unix, and the start of the other major group that took part in the “Unix wars”.

### fdopen

**Open a stream on a system path number**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

FILE *fdopen (fd, mode)
int fd;
char *mode;
```

#### Description

fdopen associates a streamwith an existing path number fd. Themode of the stream (one of the values "r", "r+", "w", "w+", "a", "a+", "d"; see fopen() for details) must be compatible with the mode the path number was opened with. The file position indicator of the new stream is set to that belonging to fd, and the error and end-of-file indicators are cleared. The path number is not duplicated, and will be closed when the stream is closed.

#### Caveats

The mode passed as an argument must be a string, not a character constant. It is a common error to pass a character literal (which is of type int) rather than a string containing one character.

#### Diagnostics

This function may fail, returning NULL if unsuccessful, and sets errno accordingly.

#### Bugs

This implementation does not currently support the bmodifier from the ANSI standard for mode. If used, fdopen will fail.

#### Conforming To

The function fdopen also exists in POSIX.1, OSK, and OS-9000.

#### See Also
[fopen()](#fopen-freopen), [fclose()](#fclose), system call open()

### fileno

**Get system path number from stream**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int fileno (stream)
FILE *stream;
```

#### Description

fileno returns the OS-9 path number used to implement stream. The path number is still owned by stream, and will be closed when fclose() is called on it. If it’s necessary for the path number to survive the closing of stream, or if passing the path number to code that may potentially close it, duplicate the path number first with dup— duplicate an open path number.

#### Caveats

This function is implemented as a macro in <stdio.h>, so its name may not be redeclared.

#### Conforming To

The function fileno also exists in POSIX.1, OSK, and OS-9000.

#### See Also
System call open()

### findstr, findnstr

**Substring searches**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <strings.h>

int findstr (pos, haystack, needle)
int pos;
char *haystack, *needle;

int findnstr (pos, haystack, needle, count)
int pos, count;
char *haystack, *needle;
```

#### Description

These functions search the string pointed to by haystack for the first instance of the string pointed to by needle, starting at position pos. The returned value is the position, within haystack, of the first matched character in needle, or zero if a match is not found. findstr stops searching when a null byte is encountered in haystack.

findnstr is similar, except it only stops searching at position pos + count, so it may continue past null bytes.

#### Notes

Because the returned value is suitable for use as an argument, these functions may be repeated to find the same substring in multiple locations within a string, or different strings without backtracking. When findnstr is used in this manner, count should be adjusted to prevent seeking past the end of the buffer.

#### Caveats

The first position is 1, not zero. The current implementation does not use the most efficient algorithm for pattern matching so that use on very long strings is likely to be somewhat slower than it might be.

#### See Also
[strchr()](#strchr-strrchr), [strpfx()](#strpfx), [strrchr()](#strchr-strrchr)

### getw, putw

**Input and output of words (ints)**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int getw (stream)
FILE *stream;

int putw (w, stream)
int w;
FILE *stream;
```

#### Description

getw reads a word from stream. That is, it reads the next two bytes as an int, assuming they are in the correct order for the host.

putw writes the integer value w to stream in the host’s natural byte order.

#### Return Value

On success, getw returns the value read, and putw returns 0. On error, both return EOF.

#### Bugs

```text
The value returned for an error condition is also a legitimate data value. It’s possible to use
ferror() to distinguish between a correct read of the value of EOF and an error.
```

#### Conforming To

These functions also exist in the SVID, OSK, and OS-9000.

### ibrk

**Request internal memory**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

char *ibrk (size)
size_t size;
```

#### Description

This function requests a pointer from within the program’s initial memory reservation. At program start, this internal memory is fixed in size by the system based on the program module’s header as well as by the calling program (usually the Shell). Within this region the stack pointer starts at the top, and called functions temporarily allocate their local variables in the stack space. In this way, the stack grows down. Similarly, the program’s global variables are located at the bottom of the internal memory, and limit how much of it may be used by the stack.

ibrk returns a pointer to a block of memory of size bytes. Thememory fromwhich ibrk grants requests is the region between the end of the current maximum data allocation, and the current location of the stack. If the requested size would cause the data allocation to cross the stack pointer, the request fails. Use freemem() to find the current amount of unused internal memory.

#### Return Value

On success, ibrk returns a pointer to a buffer of size bytes, or (char *)-1 if not enough internal memory is available.

#### Notes

See the Memory Management section of the C compiler manual for a more complete explanation of how memory is laid out in OS-9 C programs. malloc() does not use internal memory.

#### Caveats

Be careful to leave space for the stack when using ibrk calls. When the program is compiled with stack checking enabled, the program aborts if calling a function would cause the stack to overwrite variables, with the error message: *** Stack Overflow ***. Without stack checking, there is no protection from such a “stack smash,” but stack checks are often disabled for performance reasons.

#### Conforming To

The ibrk function also exists in OSK and OS-9000.

#### See Also
malloc(), system calls brk(), [sbrk()](#brk-sbrk)

### inv, sqr

**Get the inverse of or square a number**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <math.h>

double inv (x)
double x;

double sqr (x)
double x;
```

Link with -t.

#### Description

The inv function divides 1.0 by the number x, returning the result.

sqr multiplies the number x by itself, returning the result. Because these functions use assembly algorithms that are faster (but larger) than the code the compiler emits for the equivalent expressions, in situations where speed is more important than size using inv or sqrmay be a good choice.

#### See Also
[sqrt()](#sqrt)

### l3tol, ltol3

**Convert between 3-byte and long integers**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

l3tol (lp, cp, n)
long *lp;
char *cp;

ltol3 (cp, lp, n)
char *cp;
long *lp;
```

#### Description

l3tol converts a list of n three-byte integers packed into a byte string pointed to by cp, into a list of long integers pointed to by lp.

ltol3 does the opposite, converting from long integers (lp) to three-byte integers (cp). These functions are especially useful for native file system access under OS-9, where each sector is specified using a 3 byte logical sector number. Converting a 3-byte disk address to a long int allows regular C arithmetic to be performed on it.

#### Conforming To

These functions also exist on the PDP-11 versions of Unix.

### min, max, umin, umax

**Compare integers**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int min (i1, i2)
int i1, i2;

int max (i1, i2)
int i1, i2;

unsigned umin (i1, i2)
unsigned u1, u2;

unsigned umax (i1, i2)
unsigned u1, u2;
```

#### Description

The min and umin functions return either i1 or i2, whichever has the lower value. The max and umax functions are similar, except they return the larger value. The two sets of functions dJ iffer only in the signedness of the comparison — min and max compare w −32768..32767K, while umin and umax compare within the range J0..65535Kithin the range

.

### mktemp

**Create unique temporary filename**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

char *mktemp (template)
char *template;
```

#### Description

The mktemp function generates a unique temporary filename from a buffer template containing a string. The last five (or more) characters of template must be XXXXX; these are replaced with a string that makes the filename (trivially) unique.

#### Notes

Since it will be modified, templatemust not be a string constant, and should be declared as a character array.

#### Bugs

mktemp is not a secure method of creating a temporary file. The current method of generating a name is to replace the trailing XXXXXwith the program’s task IDnumber, which is easily predictable. For example, if the contents of template start out as foo.XXXXX, and the program’s task ID is 351, then template will be rewritten to contain foo.351. Because mktemp does not attempt to create or open the file, there exists a race condition between testing whether the temporary filename actually exists and the creation of the file.

#### Conforming To

The function mktemp also exists in BSD Unix, POSIX.1, OSK, and OS-9000.

#### See Also
System call getpid — get the task id

### sleep

**Sleep for a specified number of seconds**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <unistd.h>

OR
#include <signal.h>

unsigned sleep (seconds)
unsigned seconds;
```

#### Description

sleep causes the calling process to sleep either until the number of seconds has elapsed, or until a signal arrives which is not currently being ignored. If seconds is zero, the task will sleep for one tick of the system clock, which may differ between systems.

#### Return Value

sleep returns zero if the requested time has elapsed. If the requested time has not elapsed, the remaining number of system clock ticks is returned.

#### Notes

This function uses the system call tsleep(), and does not alter the return value. Because of this, the number returned is not in seconds (as it is on Unix), but in system ticks.

• On most machines running (Nitr)OS-9 Level One, there are 10 ticks each second.

• On most machines running (Nitr)OS-9 Level Two, there are 100 ticks per second.

• A big exception to this rule of thumb is the Tandy Color Computer, on which there are either 50 or 60 ticks per second (depending on the hardware mode).

#### Conforming To

The function sleep also exists in POSIX.1, OSK, and OS-9000.

#### See Also
System call tsleep()

### stacksize, freemem

**get stack reservation info**

#### Synopsis

```c
size_t stacksize();
size_t freemem();
```

#### Description

For a description of the meaning and use of this call, the user is referred to the Memory Management section of the C compiler manual. If the stack checking code is enabled, a call to stacksize returns the maximum number of bytes of stack used at the time of the call. This call can be used to determine the stack size required by a program.

freemem returns the number of bytes of the stack that has not been used.

#### See Also
[ibrk()](#ibrk), System call sbrk(), Global variable memend and constant end.

### _strass

**byte by byte copy**

#### Synopsis

```c
_strass(char *s1, char *s2, int count);
```

#### Description

Until such time as the compiler can deal with structure assignment, this function is useful for copying one structure to another. ”Count” bytes are copied from memory location at ”s2” to memory as ”s1” regardless of the contents.

### strclr

**Clear a string**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <strings.h>

char *strclr (s, n)
char *s;
int n;
```

#### Description

The strclr function writes n null bytes ('\0') into the buffer pointed to by s. No attempt is made to verify the buffer is large enough to hold n bytes.

#### See Also
memcpy()

### strpfx

**Check string prefix**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <strings.h>

int strpfx (s, prefix)
char *s, *prefix;
```

#### Description

The strpfx function returns nonzero if the string prefix is a prefix of s, zero otherwise.

#### Notes

The empty string, "", is a prefix of every string (including itself).

### strucmp, strnucmp, strucpy, strucat

**Uppercase string functions**

### strhcpy

**Copy an OS-9 string**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <strings.h>

char *strhcpy (dest, src)
char *dest, *src;
```

#### Description

The strhcpy function copies characters from src into the buffer pointed at by dest, until encountering a character that has the high bit set. That character is copied without its high bit, and a terminating null byte ('\0') is appended. This function is useful for dealing with strings returned by OS-9 system calls, the last characters of which are ORed with the value 128 to make them negative.

## Chapter 3. OS-9 System Calls

This section of the C compiler manual is a guide to the system calls available from C programs. It is not intended as a definitive description of OS-9 service requests as these are described in the OS-9 System Programmer’s Manual. However, for most calls, enough information is available here to enable the programmer to write systems calls into programs without looking further. The names used for the system calls are chosen so that programs transported from other machines or operating systems should compile and runwith as littlemodification as possible. However, care should be taken as the parameters and returned values of some calls may not be compatible with those on other systems. Programmers that are already familiar with OS- 9 names and values should take particular care. Some calls do not share the same names as the OS-9 assembly language equivalents. The assembly language equivalent call is shown, where there is one, on the relevant page of the C call description, and a cross-reference list is provided for those already familiar with OS-9 calls. The normal error signal on return from a system call is a returned value of -1. The relevant error will be found in the predefined int errno. errno always contains the error from the last erroneous system call. Definitions for the errors for inclusion in the programs are in <errno.h>. In the ”See Also” sections on the following pages, unless otherwise stated, the references are to other system calls. Where header files are shown, it is notmandatory to include them, but itmight be convenient to use the manifest constants defined in them rather than integers; it certainly makes for more readable programs.

Stub-implemented system calls For compatibility reasons, it is sometimes useful to provide “system calls” that do nothing. These are “stub” implementations.

lock On Unix, the lock system call prevents the current process from being swapped out (evicted from memory while asleep). OS-9 does not swap processes out, so this function is not needed.

sync On Unix, the sync system call causes all uncommitted (cached) writes to be committed to disk, synchronizing the state of the file system. In order to maintain predictable real-time behavior, OS-9 does not cache disk writes, so this function has no use.

### access

**Check user’s permissions for a file**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <modes.h>

OR
#include <unistd.h>

int access (pathname, mode)
char *pathname;
int mode;
```

#### Description

The access function checks whether the calling process can access pathname using file access mode mode. The mode specifies the accessibility check(s) to be performed. Its value may be any OS-9 file mode as used by open() or creat(), or it may be zero (which tests for mere existence). The OS-9 header <modes.h> defines the following symbolic constants for mode which may be combined using the bitwise OR operator: #define FAM_READ (0001) /* may be opened for reading */ #define FAM_WRITE (0002) /* may be opened for writing */ #define FAM_EXEC (0004) /* executable (or searchable, if dir) */ #define FAM_NONSHARE (0100) /* open exclusively */ #define FAM_DIR (0200) /* directory mode */

```text
When using the UNIX header <unistd.h>, the following symbolic constants (which may
also be combined) are defined:
#define F_OK (0) /* Path exists */
#define R_OK (1) /* Path is readable */
#define W_OK (2) /* Path is writable */
#define X_OK (4) /* Path is executable / searchable */
```

#### Return Value

This function returns 0 on success, and -1 on failure. In case of failure, errno is set.

#### Caveats

The set of numeric values for mode are not directly compatible with other systems. As such, be sure to use the appropriate symbolic constants for code intended to be portable, and closely examine calls to accessmade by foreign code.

### brk, sbrk

**change data area size**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int brk (addr)
char *addr;

char *sbrk (increment)
intptr_t increment;
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$Mem
```

#### Description

These system calls request changes in the location of the program break, which defines the end of the program’s data area. Increasing the program break allocates memory to the program, while decreasing the break releases memory back to the operating system. OS-9 does not allow a program to have a split data area, so if it’s not possible to add memory after the current program break, then it is not possible to increase the size of the data area at all. These system calls are quite low level; in most cases, it is better to use the malloc() family of library functions, since they are portable, easy to use, and in most cases safer.

brk requests that the highest page of the program’s data area should include the address addr, allocating or freeing memory as necessary.

sbrk increases the program’s data area by increment bytes.

#### Return Value

On success, brk returns zero, and sbrk returns the previous value of the program break, which becomes a pointer the base of a buffer increment bytes in size. On error, both functions return (char *)-1 and errno is set.

#### Notes

Calling sbrk with an increment of zero returns the current location of the program break; however, the global variable memend (though not specified in Unix) contains this same value. On Level One systems, these calls may fail even when the system has free memory. Another programmay have requestedmemory in a location adjacent to the program, or that prevents the program’s data area from expanding enough to satisfy the request. Level Two systems do not have this restriction, since each process is granted its own independent address space.

See the Memory Management section of the C compiler manual for a more complete explanation of how memory is laid out in OS-9 C programs.

#### Conforming To

The brk and sbrk system calls also exist in Unix-like operating systems.

[ibrk()](#ibrk), malloc()

### chain

**load and execute a new program**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <process.h>

chain (name, argsz, args, type, lang, datsz)
char *name, *args;
size_t argsz, datsz;
int type, lang;
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$Chain
```

#### Description

The action of F$Chain is described fully in the OS-9 documentation. The chain function implements the service request as described, but with one important exception: chain will never return to the caller. If there is an error, the process will abort and return to its parent process. It might be wise, therefore, for the program to check the existence and access permissions of the module before calling chain. Permissions may be checked by using modlink() or modload — return a pointer to a module structure followed by a call to munlink — unlink a module. name should point to a string containing the name of the desired program module. argsz is the length of the parameter string args, which is terminated by a newline ('\n'). The module’s type type is as found in the module header (normally 1, for a program module), and the language lang shouldmatch the language nybble in themodule header (C programs have 1 for “6809 Machine Code” here). The data size datszmay be zero, or it may contain the number of 256 byte pages to give to the new process as its initial memory segment.

#### Caveats

This function never returns, and has no diagnostic capability.

#### See Also
[os9fork()](#os9fork)

### chdir, chxdir

**change directory**

#### Synopsis

```c
chdir(char *dirname);
chxdir(char *dirname);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$ChgDir
```

#### Description

These calls change the current data directory and the current execution directory, respectively, for the running task. ”Dirname” is a pointer to a string that gives a pathname for a directory.

#### Diagnostics

Each call returns 0 after a successful call, or -1 if ”dirname” is not a directory path name, or it is not searchable.

#### See Also
OS-9 Shell commands Chd and Chx.

### chmod

**change access permissions of a file**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <modes.h>

chmod(char *fname, int perm);
```

#### Description

```text
Chmod changes the permission bits associated with a file. ”Fname” must be a pointer to a
file name, and ”perm” should contain the desired bit pattern,
The allowable bit patterns are defined in the include file as follows:
/* permissions */
#define S_IREAD 0x01 /* owner read */
#define S_IWRITE 0x02 /* owner write */
#define S_IEXEC 0x04 /* owner execute */
#define S_IOREAD 0x08 /* public read */
#define S_IOWRITE 0x10 /* public write */
#define S_IOEXEC 0x20 /* public execute */
#define S_ISHARE 0x40 /* sharable */
#define S_IFDIR 0x80 /* directory */
```

Only the owner or the super user may change the permissions of a file.

#### Diagnostics

A successful call returns 0. A -1 is returned if the caller is not entitled to change permissions of ”fname” cannot be found.

#### See Also
OS-9 command Attr

### chown

**change the ownership of a file**

#### Synopsis

```c
chown(char *fname, int ownerid);
```

#### Description

This call is available only to the super user. ”Fname” is a pointer to a file name, and ”ownerid” is the new user-id.

#### Diagnostics

Zero is returned from a successful call. -1 is returned from on error.

### close

**close a file**

#### Synopsis

```c
close(int pn);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$Close
```

#### Description

Close takes a path number, ”pn”, as returned from system calls ”open()”, ”creat()”, or ”dup()”, and closes the associated file. Termination of a task always closes all open files automatically, but it is necessary to close files where multiple files are opened by the task, and it is desired to re-use path numbers to avoid going over the system or process path number limit.

#### See Also
[creat()](#creat), [open()](#open), dup — duplicate an open path number

### crc

**compute a cyclic redundancy count**

#### Synopsis

```c
crc(char *start, int count, char accum[3]);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$CRC
```

#### Description

This call accumulates a crc into a three byte array at ”accum” for ”count” bytes starting at ”start”. All three bytes of ”accum” should be initialized to 0xff before the first call to ”crc()”. However, repeated calls can be subsequently made to cover an entire module. If the result is to be used as an OS-9 module crc, it should have its bytes complemented before insertion at the end of the module.

### creat

**Create a file**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <modes.h>

int creat (pathname, mode)
char *pathname;
mode_t mode;
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$Create
```

#### Description

```text
Creat returns a path number to a new file available for writing, giving it the permissions
specified in ”perm” and making the task user the owner. If, however, ”fname” is the name
of an existing file, the file is truncated to zero length, and the ownership and permissions
remain unchanged. NOTE, that unlike the OS-9 assembler service request, creat does not
return an error if the file already exists. ”Access()” should be used to establish the existence
of a file if it is important that a file should not be overwritten.
It is unnecessary to specify writing permissions in ”perm” in order to write to the file in the
current task.
The permissions allowed are defined in the include file as follows:
#define S_IPRM 0xff /* mask for permission bits */
#define S_IREAD 0x01 /* owner read */
#define S_IWRITE 0x02 /* owner write */
#define S_IEXEC 0x04 /* owner execute */
#define S_IOREAD 0x08 /* public read */
#define S_IOWRITE 0x10 /* public write */
#define S_IOEXEC 0x20 /* public execute */
#define S_ISHARE 0x40 /* sharable */
```

Directories may not be created with this call; use ”mknod()” instead.

#### Diagnostics

This call returns -1 if there are too many files open. If the pathname cannot be searched, if permission to write is denied, or if the file exists and is a directory.

#### See Also
[Write](#write-writeln), Writeln — write to a file or device, close — close a file, chmod — change access permissions of a file

### Defdrive

**get default system drive**

#### Synopsis

```c
char *defdrive(void);
```

#### Description

A call to defdrive returns a pointer to a string containing the name of the default system drive. The method used is to consult the ”Init” module for the default directory name. The name is copied to a static data area and a pointer to it is returned.

#### Diagnostics

-1 is returned if the ”Init” module cannot be linked to.

### dup

**duplicate an open path number**

#### Synopsis

```c
dup(int pn);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 I$Dup
```

#### Description

Dup takes the path number, ”pn”, as returned from ”open()” or ”creat()” and returns another path number associated with the same file.

#### Diagnostics

A -1 is returned is the call fails because there are too many files open or the path nmber is invalid.

#### See Also
[open()](#open), [creat()](#creat), close — close a file

### exit, _exit

**Task termination**

#### Synopsis

```c
exit(int status);
_exit(int status);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$Exit
```

#### Description

Exit is the normal means of terminating a task. Exit does any cleaning up operations required before terminating, such as flushing out any file buffers (see Standard i/o), but _exit does not. A task finishing normally, that is returning from ”main()”, is equivalent to a call - ”exit(0)”. The status passed to exit is available to the parent task if it is executing a ”wait”.

#### Caveats

In older versions of this implementation, normal termination of aCprogramwith no explicit call to exit, _exit — Task termination unconditionally called exit(0) after returning from the main function. The current version uses the value returned from main as the exit status if no call to exit, _exit — Task termination is made. Note that the C language requires a value to be returned from main.

#### See Also
wait — wait for child process to end

### getpid

**get the task id**

#### Synopsis

```c
getpid(void);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$ID
```

#### Description

Anumber unique to the current running task is often useful in creating names for temporary files. This call returns the task’s system id (as returned to its parent by ”os9fork”).

#### Description

```text
os9fork(), standard library function mktemp().
```

### getstat

**get file status**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <sgstat.h>
/* code 0 */

getstat(int code, int filenum, char *buffer);

/* codes 1 and 6 */

getstat(int code, int filenum);

/* code 2 */

getstat(int code, int filenum, long *size);

/* code 5 */

getstat(int code, int filenum, long *pos);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 I$GetStt
```

#### Description

A full description of getstat can be found in the OS-9 System Programmer’s Manual. ”Code” must be the value of one of the standard codes for the getstat service request. ”Filenum” must be the path number of an open file. The form of the call depends on the value of ”code”.

”Buffer”must be the address of a 32 byte buffer into which the relevant status packet is copied.

Code 0: The header file has the definitions of the various file and device structures for use by the program.

Code 1 only applies to SCF devices and to test Code 1: for data available. The return value is zero if

there is data available. -1 is returned if there is no data. ”Size” should be the address of a long integer

Code 2: into which the current file size is placed. The return value of the function is -1 on error and 0 on success. ”Pos” should be the address of a long integer

Code 5: into which the current file position is placed. The return value of the function is -1 on error and 0 on success.

Code 6: Returns -1 on EOF and error and 0 on success.

NOTE that when one of the previous calls returns -1, then actual error is returned in errno.

### getuid

**return user id**

#### Synopsis

```c
uid_t getuid ();
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$ID
```

#### Description

Getuid returns the real user id of the current task (as maintained in the password file).

### intercept

**set function for interrupt processing**

#### Synopsis

```c
intercept(int (* func) (int));
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$Icpt
```

#### Description

Intercept instructs OS-9 to pass control to the function ”func” when an interrupt (signal) is received by the current process. If the interrupt processing function has an argument, it will contain the value of the signal received. On return from ”func”, the process resumes at the point in the program where it was interrupted by the signal. ”Interrupt()” is an alternative to the use of ”signal()” to process interrupts. As an example, suppose we wish to ensure that a partially completed output file is deleted if an interrupt is received. The body of the program might include: char *temp_file = "temp"; /* name of temporary file */ int pn=0; /* path number */ int intrupt(); /* predeclaration */

...

```text
intercept(intrupt); /* route interrupt processing */
pn = creat(temp_file,3); /* make a new file */
```

...

```text
write(pn,string,count); /* write string to temp file */
```

...

```text
close(pn);
pn=0;
```

...

```text
The interrupt routine might be coded:
intrupt(sig);
{
```

```text
if (pn){ /* only done if pn refers to an open file */
close(pn);
```

```text
unlink(temp_file); /* delete */
}
```

```text
exit(sig);
}
```

#### Caveats

”Intercept()” and ”signal()” are mutually incompatible so that calls to both must not appear in the same program. The linker guards against this by giving an ”entry name clash - _sigint” error if it is attempted.

#### See Also
signal — catch or ignore interrupts

### kill

**Send a signal to a process**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <signal.h>

int kill (pid, sig)
pid_t pid;
int sig;
```

#### Description

```text
Kill sends the interrupt type ”interrupt” to the task with id ”tid”.
Both tasks, sender and receiver, must have the same user id unless the user is the super user.
The include file contains definitions of the defined signals as follows:
#define SIGKILL 0 /* system abort (cannot be caught or ignored) */
#define SIGWAKE 1 /* wake up */
#define SIGQUIT 2 /* keyboard abort */
#define SIGINT 3 /* keyboard interrupt */
#define SIGWINCH 4 /* window change */
#define SIGHUP 4 /* hang up */
#define SIGALRM 5 /* alarm signal */
```

Other user-defined signals may, of course, be sent.

#### Diagnostics

Kill returns 0 from a successful call and -1 if the task does not exist, the effective user ids do not match, or the user is not the system manager.

#### See Also
intercept — set function for interrupt processing, signal — catch or ignore interrupts, OS-9 Shell command kill

### lseek

**position in file**

#### Synopsis

```c
long lseek(int pn, long position, int type);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 I$Seek
```

#### Description

The read or write pointer for the open file with the path number, ”pn”, is positioned by lseek to the specified place in the file. The ”type” indicates fromwhere ”position” is to bemeasured: if 0, from the beginning of the file, if 1, from the current location, or if 2, from the end of the file. Seeking to a location beyond the end of a file open for writing and then writing to it, creates a ”hole” in the file which appears to be filled with zeros from the previous end to the position sought. The returned value is the resulting position in the file unless there is an error, so to find out the current position use lseek(pn,0l,1);

#### Caveats

The argument ”position” must be a long integer. Constants should be explicitly made long by appending an ”l”, as above, and other types should be converted using a cast: e.g. lseek(pn,(long)pos,1); Notice also, that the return value from lseek is itself a long integer.

#### Diagnostics

-1 is returned if ”pn” is a bad path number, or attempting to seek to a position before the beginning of a file.

#### See Also
[creat()](#creat), [open()](#open), standard library function fseek()

### mkdir

**Create a directory**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <modes.h>
mknod(char *fname, int desc);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$MakDir
```

#### Description

```text
This call may be used to create a new directory. ”Fname” should point to a string containing
the desired name of the directory. ”Desc” is a descriptor specifying the desired mode (file
type) and permissions of the new file.
The include file defines the possible values for ”desc” as follows:
#define S_IREAD 0x01 /* owner read */
#define S_IWRITE 0x02 /* owner write */
#define S_IEXEC 0x04 /* owner execute */
#define S_IOREAD 0x08 /* public read */
#define S_IOWRITE 0x10 /* public write */
#define S_IOEXEC 0x20 /* public execute */
#define S_ISHARE 0x40 /* sharable */
```

#### Diagnostics

Zero is returned if the directory has been successfully made; -1 if the file already exists.

### modload

**return a pointer to amodule structure**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <module.h>

mod_exec *modlink(char *modname, int type, int language);
mod_exec *modload(char *modname, int type, int language);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$LINK
os9 F$LOAD
```

#### Description

Each of these calls return a pointer to an OS-9 memory module.

modlink will search themodule directory for amodule with the same name as ”modname” and, if found, increment its link count. Modload will open the file which has the path list specified by ”filename” and loads modules from the file adding them to the module directory. The returned value is a pointer to the first module loaded. Above, each is shown as returning a pointer to an executable module, but it will return a pointer to whatever type of module is found.

#### Diagnostics

-1 is returned on error.

### munlink

**unlink amodule**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <module.h>

munlink(mod_exec *mod);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$UNLINK
```

#### Description

This call informs the system that the module pointed to by ”mod” is no longer required by the current process. Its link count is decremented, and the module is removed from the module directory if the link count reaches zero.

#### See Also
modlink(), modload — return a pointer to a module structure

### open

**Open a file**

#### Synopsis

```c
int open (pathname, flags)
char *pathname;
int flags;
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 I$Open
```

#### Description

This call opens an existing file for reading if ”mode” is 1, writing if ”mode” is 2, or reading and writing if ”mode” is 3. NOTE that these values are OS-9 specific and not compatible with other systems. ”Fname” should point to a string representing the pathname of the file. Open returns an integer as ”path number” which should be used by i/o system calls referring to the file. The position where reads or writes start is at the beginning of the file.

#### Diagnostics

-1 is returned if the file does not exist, if the pathname cannot be searched, if too many files are already open, or if the file permissions deny the requested mode.

### os9fork

**create a process**

#### Synopsis

```c
int os9fork (name, argsz, args, type, lang, datsz)
char *name, *args;
size_t argsz, datsz;
int type, lang;
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$Fork
```

#### Description

The os9fork function creates a child process to run concurrently with the calling process. When this “forked” process terminates, it returns to the calling process. name should point to a string containing name of the desired programmodule. argsz is the length of the parameter string args, which is terminated by a newline ('\n'). The module’s type type is as found in the module header (normally 1, for a program module), and the language lang should match the language nybble in the module header (C programs have 1 for 6809machine code here). The data size datszmay be zero, or it may contain the number of 256 byte pages to give to the new process as its initial memory segment.

#### Notes

Despite its name, os9fork does not work in the same way that the Unix fork() system call does; it is more similar to the spawn function fromMicrosoft Windows. The action of F$Fork is described fully in the OS-9 System Programmer’s Manual.

#### Diagnostics

On success, the task ID number of the child process is returned; otherwise, EOF is returned and errno is set accordingly.

### pause

**halt and wait for interrupt**

#### Synopsis

```c
pause(void);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 I$SLEEP (with a value of 0)
```

#### Description

Pause may be used to halt a task until an interrupt is received from ”kill”. Pause always returns -1.

#### See Also
[kill()](#kill), signal — catch or ignore interrupts, OS-9 shell command kill

### prerr

**print error message**

#### Synopsis

```c
prerr(int filnum, int errcode);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$PERR
```

#### Description

PRERR prints an error message on the output path as specified by ”filnum” which must be the path number of an open file. The message depends on ”errcode” which will normally be a standard OS-9 error code.

### read, readln

**read from a file**

#### Synopsis

```c
read(int pn, char *buffer, int count);
readln(int pn, char *buffer, int count);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 I$Read
os9 I$ReadLn
```

#### Description

The path number, ”pn” is an integer which is one of the standard path numbers 0, 1, or 2, or the path number should have been returned by a successful call to ”open”, ”creat”, or ”dup”. ”Buffer” is a pointer to space with at least ”count” bytes of memory into which read will put the data from the file. It is guaranteed that at most ”count” bytes will be read, but often less will be, either because, for readln, the file represents a terminal and input stops at the end of a line, or for both, end-of-file has been reached.

readln causes ”line-editing” such as echoing to take place and returns once the first ”\n” is encountered in the input or the number of bytes requested has been read. Readln is the preferred call for reading from the user’s terminal. Read does not cause any such editing. See the OS-9 manual for a fuller description of the actions of these calls.

#### Diagnostics

Read and readln return the number of bytes actually read (0 at end-of-file) or -1 for physical i/o errors, a bad path number, or a ridicolous ”count”. NOTE that end-of-file is not considered an error, and no error indication is returned. Zero is returned on EOF.

[open()](#open), [creat()](#creat), dup — duplicate an open path number

### setpr

**set process priority**

#### Synopsis

```c
setpr(int pid, int priority);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$SPRIOR
```

#### Description

SETPR sets the process identified by ”pid” (process id) to have a priority of ”priority”. The lowest level is 0 and the highest is 255.

#### Diagnostics

The call will return -1 if the process does not have the same user id as the caller.

### setime, getime

**set and get system time**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <time.h>

setime(struct sgtbuf *buffer);
getime(struct sgtbuf *buffer);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$STIME
os9 F$GTIME
```

#### Description

GETIME returns system time in buffer. SETIME sets system time from buffer.

### setuid

**set user id**

#### Synopsis

```c
setuid(int uid);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$SUSER
```

#### Description

This call may be used to set the user id for the current task. Setuid only works if the caller is the super user (user id 0).

#### Diagnostics

Zero is returned from a successful call, and -1 is returned on error.

#### See Also
getuid — return user id

### setstat

**set file status**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <sgstat.h>
/* code 0 */

setstat(int code, int filenum, char *buffer);

/* code 2 */

setstat(int code, int filenum, long size);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$SETSTT
```

#### Description

For a detailed explanation of this call, see the OS-9 System Programmer’s Manual. ”Filenum” must be the path number of a currently open file. The only values for code at this time are 0 and 2. When ”code” is 0, ”buffer” should be the address of a 32 byte structure which is written to the option section of the path descriptor of the file. The header file contains definitions of various structures maintained by OS-9 for use by the programmer. When code is 2, ”size” should be a long integer specifying the new file size.

### signal

**catch or ignore interrupts**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <signal.h>

typedef int (*sighandler_t)(int);

sighandler_t signal(int interrupt, sighandler_t address);
```

#### Description

This call is a comprehensive method of catching or ignoring signals sent to the current process. Notice that ”kill()” does the sending of signals, and ”signal()” does the catching. Normally, a signal sent to a process causes it to terminate with the status of the signal. If, in advance of the anticipated signal, this system call is used, the program has the choice of ignoring the signal or designating a function to be executed when it is received. Different functions may be designated for different signals. The values for ”address” have the following meanings:

0 reset to the default i.e. abort when received. 1 ignore; this will apply until reset to another

value. Otherwise taken to be the address of a C function which

is to be executed on receipt of the signal.

If the latter case is chosen, when the signal is received by the process the ”address” is reset to 0, the default, before the function is executed. Thismeans that if the next signal received should be caught then another call to ”signal()” should be made immediately. This is normally the first action taken by the ”interrupt” function. The function may access the signal number which caused its execution by looking at its argument. On completion of this function the program resumes at the point at which is was ”interrupted” by the signal. An example should help to clarify all this. Suppose a programneeds to create a temporary file which should be deleted before exiting. The body of the program might contain fragments like this: pn = creat("temp",3); /* create a temporary file */ signal(2,intrupt); /* ensure tidying up */ signal(3,intrupt); write(pn,string,count); close(pn); /* finished writing */ unlink("temp"); /* delete it */ exit(0); /* normal exit */

Thecall to ”signal()” will ensure that if a keyboard or quit signal is received then the function ”intrupt()” will be executed and this might be written:

```text
intrupt(sig)
{
close(pn); /* close it if open */
unlink("temp"); /* delete it */
exit(sig); /* received signal er exit status */
}
```

In this case, as the function will be exiting before another signal is received, it is unnecessary to call ”signal()” again to reset its pointer. Note that either the function ”intrupt()” should appear in the source code before the call to ”signal()”, or it should be pre-declared. The signals used by OS-9 are defined in the header file as follows: /* OS-9 signals */ #define SIGKILL 0 /* system abort (cannot be caught or ignored)

```text
*/
#define SIGWAKE 1 /* wake up */
#define SIGQUIT 2 /* keyboard abort */
#define SIGINT 3 /* keyboard interrupt */
```

```text
/* special addresses */
#define SIG_DFL 0 /* reset to default */
#define SIG_IGN 1 /* ignore */
```

Please note that there is another method of trapping signals, namely ”intercept()” (q.v.). However, since ”signal()” and ”intercept()” are mutually incompatible, calls to both of them must not appear in the same program. The link-loader will preven the creation of an executable program in which both are called by aborting with an ”entry name clash” error for ”_sigint”.

intercept — set function for interrupt processing, [kill()](#kill), OS-9 Shell command kill

### tsleep

**put process to sleep**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <signal.h>

unsigned tsleep (ticks)
unsigned ticks;
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$Sleep
```

#### Description

The tsleep system call deactivates the calling process until the number of system ticks requested has elapsed, or indefinitely if ticks is zero. If ticks is 1, the effect will be to yield the rest of the current time slice. Because the programwill be awakened if a signal is received, sleeping indefinitely is an excellent way to wait for a signal or interrupt without wasting CPU time. The length of a system clock tick is system-dependent, but is usually between 10 and 100 milliseconds:

• On most Level One systems, a clock tick is 100 milliseconds (1/10 of a second).

• On most Level Two systems, a clock tick is 10 milliseconds (1/100 of a second).

• On Tandy Color Computers, a clock tick is either 16.66… or 20 milliseconds.

Because it is not known when the call to tsleep was made, this call cannot be used for precise timekeeping. A sleep of one tick is effectively a “yield remaining time slice” request; the process will be placed in the active process list (the “run queue”), and will resume when it reaches the front of the queue. A sleep of N = 2 or more ticks delays the insertion until N − 1 ticks have elapsed, and then the program resumes when it reaches the front of the run queue.

#### Caveats

The system clock must be running to perform a timed sleep; it is not required to perform an indefinite sleep, or to give up a time slice.

#### See Also
[kill()](#kill), wait — wait for child process to end, library function sleep()

### Unlink

**remove directory entry**

#### Synopsis

```c
unlink(char *fname);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 I$DELETE
```

#### Description

Unlink deletes the directory entry whose name is pointed to by ”fname”. If the entry was the last link to the file, the file itself is deleted and the disc space occupied made available for re-use. If, however the file is open, in any active task, the deletion of the actual file is delayed until the file is closed.

#### Diagnostics

Zero is returned from a successful call, -1 if the file does not exist, if its directory is writeprotected, or cannot be searched, if the file is a non-empty directory or a device.

#### See Also
OS-9 command Del

### wait

**wait for child process to end**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

OR
#include <process.h>

pid_t wait (wstatus)
int *wstatus;
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 F$Wait
```

#### Description

The wait system call halts the calling task until a child task has terminated. If a child process has already terminated, wait returns immediately. Otherwise, it blocks until a process terminates, or a signal handler interrupts the call. If wstatus is not NULL, wait stores status information in the int to which it points. After wait returns, the integer pointed to by wstatus contains the child process’s exit status. This is usually the argument of the exit, _exit — Task termination system call, or the signal number it received if it was killed by a signal.

#### Return Value

wait returns the process ID of the task that exited, or -1 if the current process has no children.

#### Notes

On POSIX systems, wstatus may be inspected using several macros to determine the way the child terminated; however, OS-9 does not supply information enabling the C library to distinguish an exit due to signal from a normal exit. So, for compatibility with Unix, several macros are defined in <sys/wait.h>:

```text
WIFEXITED(wstatus) always returns true.
```

```text
WIFSIGNALED(wstatus) always returns false.
```

```text
WIFSTOPPED(wstatus) always returns false.
```

```text
WEXITSTATUS(wstatus) returns wstatus, the exit status of the child.
```

```text
WSTOPSIG(wstatus) returns wstatus, but since WIFSTOPPED() always returns false, should
never be called.
```

```text
WTERMSIG(wstatus) returns wstatus, but since WIFSIGNALED() always returns false,
should never be called.
```

#### Caveats

A wait call must be made for each child task the program spawns; until a terminated child process’s exit status has been collectedwith wait, it remains in the process table as a “zombie” (a process in the DEAD state). Toomany of these “unreaped” child processesmay even prevent new processes from being created. The values of OS-9 status codes are not necessarily compatible with those of other systems.

### Write, Writeln

**write to a file or device**

#### Synopsis

```c
write(int pn, char *buffer, int count);
writeln(int pn, char *buffer, int count);
```

#### Assembler Equivalent

```text
os9 I$WRITE
os9 I$WRITLN
```

#### Description

”Pn” must be a value returned by ”open”, ”creat” or ”dup” or should be a 0(stdin), 1(stdout), or 2(stderr). ”Buffer should point to an area of memory fromwhich ”count” bytes are to be written. Write returns the actual number of bytes written, and if this is different from ”count”, an error has occurred. Writes in multiples of 256 bytes to file offset boundaries of 256 bytes are the most efficient. Write causes no ”line-editing” to occur on output. Writeln causes line-editing and only writes up to the first ”\n” in the buffer if this is found before ”count” is exhausted. For a full description of the actions of these calls the reader is referred to the OS-9 documentation.

#### Diagnostics

-1 is returned if ”pn” is a bad path number, of ”count” is ridiculous or on physical i/o error.

#### See Also
[creat()](#creat), [open()](#open)

### _os9

**system call interface from C programs**

#### Synopsis

```c
#include <os9.h>

int _os9 (code, regs)
char code;
struct registers *regs;
```

#### Description

The _os9 function calls the OS-9 system call code directly, without using assembly language or a helper function. codemay be any value defined for the current system; the header file <funcs.h> (which is included by <os9.h>) contains a list of all codes known at this time¹. The input registers (regs) for system calls are accessed using the following structure, defined in <os9.h>: struct registers {

char rg_cc, /* condition codes */ rg_a, /* 6809 accumulator A */ rg_b, /* 6809 accumulator B */ rg_dp; /* 6809 direct page register */

unsigned rg_x, /* 6809 index register X */ rg_y, /* 6809 index register Y */ rg_u; /* 6809 combo register U */

```text
};
```

#### Diagnostics

-1 is returned if the OS-9 call failed. 0 is returned on success.
